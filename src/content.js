  //   text: `In the far north, buried soil known as permafrost used to stay frozen year round. But the Arctic is warming more quickly than the rest of the planet. Each summer, more frozen land thaws for a longer time. Scientists are working to explain why the thaw is outpacing even their worst case predictions. The mystery is urgent--melting permafrost releases carbon dioxide, a gas that accelerates the pace of global warming.`,

  //   text: `U-M researchers studying the warming Arctic witness firsthand the effects of climate change. They track the movement of heat energy from the Sun to air, water, and soil. They note the northward creep of the tree line, with shrubs and forests emerging where none have grown for thousands of years.\nThe carbon trapped in the permafrost is greater than that contained in the entire Amazon rainforest.\nCurrently, there is a vicious cycle, in which the Arctic warms, the permafrost thaws, //   carbon is released, and warming accelerates. U-M researchers led by Valeriy Ivanov are working with other partner universities to monitor feedback mechanisms accelerating Artic climate warming, and determine all the factors and interactions that are affecting the permafrost.`

      title: "What is the future of rainforests",
      text: `The planet’s future may depend on building a deeper understanding of ecohydrology in the Amazon. *Ecohydrology* is the study of the connections between living things and water. In the coming decades the climate crisis will result in an Amazon rainforest that’s hotter and drier than at any previous point in human history. Understanding the science behind the rainforest could help researchers predict future global impacts due to climate change and seek solutions.`,

      title: "Drying out the Amazon Rainforest",
      text: `In the early 2000s a massive drought hit the Amazon basin. Researchers expected the forest canopy to shut down—but they found the opposite. While some species did pull back to conserve water, others got greener even through the driest period.\nBiological diversity makes ecosystems resilient. Individual species react to conditions differently, and researchers are beginning to understand how these distinct behaviors affect the function of the ecosystem as a whole. By understanding the diversity of plants in the rainforest canopy, researchers can predict how the Amazon rainforest will transform in the future as the climate changes.`,
